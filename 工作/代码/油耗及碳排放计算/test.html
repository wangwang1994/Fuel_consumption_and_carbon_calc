    A few key numbers: The auto sector is directly responsible for more than 8.6% of the overall
    manufacturing employment in Europe, with more than 60% of workers employed by automotive suppliers.
    Of those 1.7 million direct jobs—600,000 or roughly one third—depend on internal combustion engine technology.
    Electrification of the powertrain impacts these workers directly, as fewer parts are needed in an electric
    vehicle and the manufacturing processes are more automated.
    Policy decisions that mandate only one technology choice, directly impact consumers,
    businesses and EU competitiveness in a very real and disruptive way
To obtain a much needed European-wide assessment of the impact on jobs and
    value creation in automotive powertrain manufacturing, CLEPA commissioned
    a one-of-a-kind study evaluating the impact of three different pathways to reach Green Deal objectives,
    with a focus on automotive suppliers in the EU, and in seven key automotive markets, until 2040.
    The results send a stark signal: an EV-only approach, with a ban on combustion engine technology,
    which is basically the approach taken in the European Commission’s ‘Fit-for-55’ package,
    puts over half a million jobs at risk, with the future economic & social fabric hinging largely on the assumption
    of a full battery production chain in Europe. By contrast, a mixed-technology scenario, combining rapid electrification
    with other sustainable low and net-carbon options, would mitigate the employment loss and make the transformation more
    manageable. Without compromising on climate goals.
